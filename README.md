# Multi Monitor Wallpaper Adjuster

Small web app project that allows you to adjust images according to any
arbitrary multi monitor setup.

The goal is to provide a simple, easy and accessible way to generate image files
for use in multi monitor setups, for systems like most Linux DEs where there
isn't a native way to adjust how images span across monitors, for example.
